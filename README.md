Salinity			Measured as ppt using a handheld salinity meter (HI-98319, Hanna Instruments)

Microstructure		As determined by the literature and SEM micrographs

Microstructure_b	Common microstructures

Species				Genus and species name

Mineralogy			Aragonitic or calcitic polymorph

Block_ID			Individual blocks were labelled on removal from the tubs

Measurement			Max change in depth was measured using one transect across the whole surface shell, in addition to four 2-point measurements made from the centre out

Shell_loss			Measured in micrometers

Magnification		Magnification of the microscope when measurement was made

Organics			Determined by thermogravimetric analysis as proportion of weight

Mg:Ca				Ratio of magnesium to calcium in the calcitic microstructures

Crystal size		Measured in micrometers on SEM micrographs


Spreadsheet 2: Crystal size

15 measurements of crystal size (measured in micrometers) using ImageJ on SEM micrographs. Average and standard deviations were calculated.


Spreadsheet 3: Organic content

Determined by thermogravimetric analysis as proportion of weight.
